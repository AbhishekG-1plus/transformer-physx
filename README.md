### Road Map

This is an on going project, hence many parts are not fully developed and will be added in the near future.
This may be because these parts are not complete or they are intentionally left out until full publication due to predatory large labs.
Thanks for understanding.

- Transformer Documentation
- Embedding model training files
- Numerical example data
- Add two example scripts to demonstrate training/prediction
- Parallel Data training for transformer
- Unsupervised pretraining physics
